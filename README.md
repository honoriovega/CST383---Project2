# Final Project
Your goal is to complete a small but professional data science project.  
## Project guidelines
- You pick the topic of the project and find the raw data.  You should pick a topic that you find interesting.
- Define a clear goal for the project.  Prof. Bruns must approve the project before you start.
- Perform all the steps that we have discussed in class and performed in homework assignments: data acquisition, data cleaning and munging, data exploration, modeling, evaluation, and preparation of a report.
- The project is not long so pick a modest goal.  Avoid spending all your time on something like producing beautiful maps.
- Your project should use the techniques we’ve covered in class.  For this project, be sure to apply machine learning methods: supervised learning (classification, regression) and unsupervised learning (cluster analysis, anomaly detection)
- Your final report should be an R Markdown document along with generated HTML.  The report should include sections covering all the steps listed above (data acquisition, cleaning, etc.).
- Meet with Prof. Bruns regularly during the project to make sure you are heading in the right direction.

## Project grading.  
I will assess your project using your final report.  The project will be graded on a scale of 0-100.  Grading will be based on these elements:

* 40% technical strength
* did you use techniques learned in class?
* did you use them correctly?
* did you show overall good technical judgement?
* 30% content
* how much work did you accomplish in the time allotted?
* 20% professional quality
* did you do something interesting or unexpected?
* did you do research to go beyond our coverage of material in class?
*   teamwork and participation
* did you participate?
* did you attend class every project day?
* were you a good team player?
* I will adjust individual grades based on participation.  Normally, the adjustment will     be between -10 and 10 points, but reserve the right to deduct up to 50 points if I           believe your participation was very low.

## Please note.
* Do not communicate with other teams on your team’s work.
* You work is to be submitted as a .Rmd file and a .html file.  Only the team manager will submit the documents.
* You cannot submit past the due date!
